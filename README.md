# Temperature Conversion Program in Assembly Language

This is a simple program written in Assembly Language that takes the temperature in Celsius from the user and converts it to Fahrenheit. The program uses   basic  arithmetic operations to perform the conversion.

Usage
To use this program, you need to assemble the source code using a suitable assembler for your platform. Once assembled, the resulting binary executable can be run to execute the program.

The program prompts the user to enter the temperature in Celsius and reads the input from the console. It then performs the conversion and displays the result in Fahrenheit.

Example
Suppose the user enters a temperature of 25°C. The program would then convert it to Fahrenheit using the formula:

°F = (°C × 9/5) + 32

Here, the value of °C is 25, so the formula becomes:

°F = (25 × 9/5) + 32
°F = 77


# Question No 1 (A Simple Branch Code)

When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter two numbers, x and y.
The program will compare the two numbers and output a new number based on the comparison.
The new number will be displayed on the screen.

# Question No 2 (Factorial Calculator)

This is a simple assembly language program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user.

How to Use

Run the program by assembling and executing the code using an appropriate assembler.
When prompted, enter a number between 0 and 9.
The program will then calculate the factorial of the entered number and display the result.

Features

Calculates the factorial of a number between 0 and 9.
Displays an error message if the entered number is out of range.
Uses assembly language for efficient execution.


# Question No 3 (A Loop with Procedure)


This is a simple assembly language code that prompts the user to enter a maximum of 5 numbers and terminates if the user enters the same number as specified by the program or if 5 numbers have been entered.

Usage
The read procedure can be called from another program to read user input. The input buffer is used to store the user input and can be modified to change the maximum number of digits that can be entered.


# Question No 4 (Simple Password Verification Program)

This is a simple password verification program written in x86 assembly language. It asks the user to enter a 5-digit password, and compares it with a hardcoded password. If the passwords match, the program grants access; otherwise, it asks the user to retry.

The program displays messages on the screen to guide the user through the process. It also uses macros to print new lines for better readability.

The code is fully commented to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.
